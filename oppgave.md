# Oppgave
The Level 1 questions are required.

The Level 2 questions are optional.

Some of the questions don't provide variable names, and you must come up with them yourself. Choosing appropriate variable names will form part of your assessment, as will proper and consistent formatting of your code.
## Level 1
### Question 1

Declare and initialise a variable with a string value.

### Question 2

Create an object variable called **person** and give it two properties (a key and a value) of your choice.

### Question 3

Create a variable called **outOfStock** and assign it a **boolean** value.

Create an **if else** statement that checks the value of outOfStock.

If it is **true**, console log **"Out of stock"**. Otherwise log **"In stock"**.

### Question 4

Create an **array** of five numbers.

Loop through the array and console log each value.

### Question 5

Create a **for loop** that counts from 15 to 25. Console log the value of the counter variable inside the loop.

### Question 6

Using the same loop from the above question, only log the value of the counter variable if it is equal to 20.

### Question 7
Create an **array** of two **objects**. Each object must have the same three properties (with different values):
- one property with a **string** value
- one property with a **number** value
- one property with a **boolean** value
Loop through the array and console log the **number** value and the **boolean** value.

### Question 8

Create a **function** called **whatIDontLike** that accepts one argument. Choose a good name for the argument.

Inside the function, log the string **"I don't like "** together with the argument.

Call the function and pass in a value of your choice.

```
Example:
If you pass in the value "giraffes", the function should log: "I don't like giraffes".
```
### Question 9

Create a **function** that accepts two arguments.

Inside the function, subtract the second argument from the first and console log the result.

### Question 10

Create an empty **array**.

Create a **function** that accepts one argument.

Inside the function, add the argument to the array.

Call the function and pass in a value of any type.
## Level 2
### Question 1

Using the loop from question 5 above, only log the counter variable if it is an even number.

```
Hint:
You can use the modulus % operator for this.
```
### Question 2

Create a **function** that logs the sentence **"I am a function"**.

Assign this function to a variable called **innerFunction**.

Create another **function** called **outerFunction** that accepts one argument.

Inside **outerFunction**, call the argument like you would a function - with parenthesis **()**.

Call **outerFunction** and pass in the **innerFunction** variable.

## Submission
- Create a repository in your GitHub account called prog-found-ca and make sure it's public
- Create a file called level-1.js
- If you answer the level 2 questions, create a file called level-2.js
- Write your answers inside these files with a comment above each answer indicating the question number:
```
// question 1

// your answer for question 1 goes here

// question 2

// your answer for question 2 goes here

// etc
```

- Add, commit and push these files to your repo
- Submit the repo link
